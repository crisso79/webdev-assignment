<p>
	My favourite player of all time is Kenny Dalglish. There have been many great players<br>
	to have put on the Liverpool jersey, but he is my favourite. Not only did he play for<br>
	Liverpool, but he also became a succesful manager of the club after the resignation of <br>
	Joe Fagan.<br>
	As a player Kenny won many trophies, including 6 league championships and 3 European cups<br>
	When he signed for Liverpool he cost a british transfer record fee, which will tell you how<br>
	good a player he was. He became the clubs player manager in 1985, and had alot of success in this <br>
	role also. After a very dark period in the clubs, and footballs history, Kenny Dalglish left his <br>
	role as club manager and took some time away from the game.
